# Round 1 solution for ML statement of Ethos Hackathon

## Approach:

1. Frame Extraction: Extract frames from the video using OpenCV to isolate images at regular intervals for further processing.

2. Face Detection: Detect faces in each extracted frame using MTCNN, cropping the face areas for enhancement.

3. Preprocessing: Align and normalize the detected faces to ensure consistency in facial orientation and size before sending them to enhancement models.

4. Facial Enhancement (GAN-based Models): Pass the cropped faces through models like CodeFormer and GFPGAN to restore and enhance facial details, improving resolution and clarity.

5. Feature Reconstruction: Enhance facial features using deep learning techniques embedded in the models, reducing blur and improving overall image quality.

6. Post-Processing: Combine the reconstructed faces with the original frames, ensuring the faces are enhanced while preserving frame continuity for any further analysis.

## Results

#### The result folder contains the comparative results tried on the video [content/market.mp4](https://github.com/Ha4sh-447/ethos-hackathon/blob/main/content/market.mp4).

The result folder contains codeFormer_result and gfpgan_result respectively.
[result/gfpgan_result/cmp](result/gfpgan_result/cmp) and [result/coderformer_result/compare](result/codeformer_result/compare) contains side by side comparison of extracted and enhanced image
